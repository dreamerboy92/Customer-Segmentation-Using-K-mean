👥 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment customers based on their behavior and spending patterns. The goal is to group similar customers together so that businesses can better target marketing strategies for each group.

🎯 Objective
To analyze customer data and group customers into distinct clusters using K-Means Clustering, based on features such as age, income, and spending score.
🧰 Tools and Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (KMeans algorithm)

🔍 Workflow
Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Checking null values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection

Data Visualization

Histograms, Pair plots

Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters

Modeling

Applying K-Means clustering

Assigning cluster labels to each customer

Interpreting customer segments

📊 Cluster Interpretation (Example)
Cluster	Age Group	Income Range	Spending Behavior
0	25–35	High	High
1	35–50	Medium	Low
2	18–25	Low	High
...	...	...	...
📈 Visualization

✅ Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm grouped customers into meaningful segments that can help businesses:

Personalize marketing campaigns

Launch targeted offers

Improve customer satisfaction and retention

📌 Future Scope
Apply hierarchical or DBSCAN clustering

Add more customer attributes (e.g., frequency, product categories)

Deploy clustering results in a dashboard (Power BI or Tableau)
